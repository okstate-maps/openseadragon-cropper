# openseadragon-cropper
This is a modified version of https://github.com/sul-dlss/iiif-cropper. This is not concerned with the plugin itself, instead, this repo is just a way to quickly host a tool to interactively select the region of a IIIF resource.

To use it, find the IIIF Image URL of the resource you are interested in. For example:

```
https://dc.library.okstate.edu/digital/iiif/OKMaps/3904/info.json
```

Then take that url and replace `<url>` below with it.

```
https://okstate-maps.github.io/openseadragon-cropper/demo/?url=<url>
```

For example:

https://okstate-maps.github.io/openseadragon-cropper/demo/?url=https://dc.library.okstate.edu/digital/iiif/OKMaps/3904/info.json
